You can play it! Find @dungeon_testbot in telegram and send it anything. It will explain the rest.
Dungeon bot is a telegram bot utilising Telegram bot API(https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) via https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-telegram-bot/2.2.

The purporse of the bot is to create a multiplayer dungeon crawling text rpg. Imagine a simplified diablo with nothing but combat, loot and leveling up.

The bot was developed with versatility in mind. That means that you can contribute! 
You can very easily add a monster, item, perk or effect.
You can add much more complex stuff and make changes to the engine too.

Good luck in the dungeons!
